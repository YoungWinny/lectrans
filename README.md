# Lecture Recording and Transcription App

This project is a **Lecture Recording and Transcription App** that allows users to record or upload audio lectures, assign them to courses and classes, and generate transcriptions using the **Vosk Speech Recognition** engine. The app also includes a feature to read and listen to transcriptions simultaneously.

---

## **Features**
- Add and manage **Classes**, **Courses**, and **Lectures**.
- Record or upload audio files for lectures.
- Generate transcriptions of audio files using the **Vosk Model**.
- View transcriptions while listening to the audio.
- Mobile-responsive interface with a user-friendly UI.

---

## **Prerequisites**
1. **Python 3.8 or higher**.
2. **FFmpeg installed** on your system (for audio processing).
3. **Vosk Speech Recognition Model**:
   - Download the model `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` from [Vosk Models](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models).
   - Extract the contents and place them in the `model/` folder in the root of the project.

### **Installing FFmpeg**
FFmpeg for Conversion: The project uses FFmpeg to convert the WebM file to WAV. This is much more reliable for handling various audio codecs that might be inside the WebM container.

#### On **Windows**:
1. Download FFmpeg from the official site: [FFmpeg Download Page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Add the FFmpeg `bin` directory to your system's `PATH`:
   - Go to **Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System Variables**, select `Path` and click **Edit**.
   - Add the path to the `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).
4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

#### On **Linux**:
1. Install FFmpeg using your package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ffmpeg
   ```
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   ffmpeg -version
   ```
