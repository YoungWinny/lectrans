one of the simplest i have to it's don't reply

ask you how to install package my accident

i was a simple installation instructions on it's website

and if you need a code editor i recommend visual studio code

these are all free and readily available

now we have the prerequisites installed let's install a rebel

if we go to be lowville reveal depository and get hope we can see all the files and folders that make up the framework

there you could download these files and placed them in your project folder

alternatively the much easier way to do it is to use this composer command

so on the command line went into the composer creates project come and using the lavelle package

the last until they come in and opened the name of the further where the project will be created uncle it level up

i recommend you keep his name simple with no eccentric cats is open to asian and in lower case

so before we will this what exactly does this come and do

first it creates a folder called maribel and then it copies the contents of the logo framework repository on can't hope to that folder

then any third party ph be packages that logo depends on a also downloaded and and lot further i'm doing some script and executed which initialize previous files and settings within the code

so that's rule that out there we can see the framework and all it's packages being installed and the initialization scripts being run

so that the folder containing the level project we just created

let's change it unfold and with pcb command and open it's eating the code editor

oh we can see all the files and folders that make up this logo project

don't worry you don't have to know what all of these do just yet
